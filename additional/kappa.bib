We conducted a dose-response meta-analysis of prospective studies to examine the dose-response associations between coffee consumption and mortality from all causes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and all cancers. Pertinent studies, published between 1966 and 2013, were identified by searching PubMed and by reviewing the reference lists of the selected articles. Prospective studies in which investigators reported relative risks of mortality from all causes, CVD, and all cancers for 3 or more categories of coffee consumption were eligible. Results from individual studies were pooled using a random-effects model. Twenty-one prospective studies, with 121,915 deaths and 997,464 participants, met the inclusion criteria. There was strong evidence of nonlinear associations between coffee consumption and mortality for all causes and CVD (P for nonlinearity {\textless} 0.001). The largest risk reductions were observed for 4 cups/day for all-cause mortality (16\%, 95\% confidence interval: 13, 18) and 3 cups/day for CVD mortality (21\%, 95\% confidence interval: 16, 26). Coffee consumption was not associated with cancer mortality. Findings from this meta-analysis indicate that coffee consumption is inversely associated with all-cause and CVD mortality.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The association between fish consumption and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is unclear. The aim of this paper was to summarize the available evidence on the association between fish consumption and risk of RA using a dose-response meta-analysis.
METHODS: Relevant studies were identified by a search of MEDLINE and EMBASE through December 2013, with no restrictions. A random-effects dose-response meta-analysis was conducted to combine study specific relative risks. Potential non-linear relation was investigated using restricted cubic splines. A stratified analysis was conducted by study design.
RESULTS: Seven studies (four case-controls and three prospective cohorts) involving a total of 174 701 participants and 3346 cases were included in the meta-analysis. For each one serving per week increment in fish consumption, the relative risk (RR) of RA was 0.96 (95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.91 to 1.01). Results did not change when stratifying by study design. No heterogeneity or publication bias was observed. When fish consumption was modeled using restricted cubic splines, the risk of RA was 20 to 24\% lower for 1 up to 3 servings per week of fish (RR =0.76, 95\% CI: 0.57 to 1.02) as compared to never consumption.
CONCLUSIONS: Results from this dose-response meta-analysis showed a non-statistically significant inverse association between fish consumption and RA.},

	abstract = {Goodness of fit evaluation should be a natural step in assessing and reporting dose-response meta-analyses from aggregated data of binary outcomes. However, little attention has been given to this topic in the epidemiological literature, and goodness of fit is rarely, if ever, assessed in practice. We briefly review the two-stage and one-stage methods used to carry out dose-response meta-analyses. We then illustrate and discuss three tools specifically aimed at testing, quantifying, and graphically evaluating the goodness of fit of dose-response meta-analyses. These tools are the deviance, the coefficient of determination, and the decorrelated residuals-versus-exposure plot. Data from two published meta-analyses are used to show how these three tools can improve the practice of quantitative synthesis of aggregated dose-response data. In fact, evaluating the degree of agreement between model predictions and empirical data can help the identification of dose-response patterns, the investigation of sources of heterogeneity, and the assessment of whether the pooled dose-response relation adequately summarizes the published results. © 2015 The Authors.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies assessing the association of non-fermented and fermented milk consumption with mortality from all causes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. PubMed was searched until August 2015. A two-stage, random-effects, dose-response meta-analysis was used to combine study-specific results. Heterogeneity among studies was assessed with the I² statistic. During follow-up periods ranging from 4.1 to 25 years, 70,743 deaths occurred among 367,505 participants. The range of non-fermented and fermented milk consumption and the shape of the associations between milk consumption and mortality differed considerably between studies. There was substantial heterogeneity among studies of non-fermented milk consumption in relation to mortality from all causes (12 studies; I² = 94\%), cardiovascular disease (five studies; I² = 93\%), and cancer (four studies; I² = 75\%) as well as among studies of fermented milk consumption and all-cause mortality (seven studies; I² = 88\%). Thus, estimating pooled hazard ratios was not appropriate. Heterogeneity among studies was observed in most subgroups defined by sex, country, and study quality. In conclusion, we observed no consistent association between milk consumption and all-cause or cause-specific mortality.},

	volume = {35},
	issn = {1097-0258},
	doi = {10.1002/sim.6980},
	abstract = {Assessing the magnitude of heterogeneity in a meta-analysis is important for determining the appropriateness of combining results. The most popular measure of heterogeneity, I(2) , was derived under an assumption of homogeneity of the within-study variances, which is almost never true, and the alternative estimator, R{\textasciicircum}I, uses the harmonic mean to estimate the average of the within-study variances, which may also lead to bias. This paper thus presents a new measure for quantifying the extent to which the variance of the pooled random-effects estimator is due to between-studies variation, R{\textasciicircum}b, that overcomes the limitations of the previous approach. We show that this measure estimates the expected value of the proportion of total variance due to between-studies variation and we present its point and interval estimators. The performance of all three heterogeneity measures is evaluated in an extensive simulation study. A negative bias for R{\textasciicircum}b was observed when the number of studies was very small and became negligible as the number of studies increased, while R{\textasciicircum}I and I(2) showed a tendency to overestimate the impact of heterogeneity. The coverage of confidence intervals based upon R{\textasciicircum}b was good across different simulation scenarios but was substantially lower for R{\textasciicircum}I and I(2) , especially for high values of heterogeneity and when a large number of studies were included in the meta-analysis. The proposed measure is implemented in a user-friendly function available for routine use in r and sas. R{\textasciicircum}b will be useful in quantifying the magnitude of heterogeneity in meta-analysis and should supplement the p-value for the test of heterogeneity obtained from the Q test.

	volume = {16},
	issn = {1471-2288},
	doi = {10.1186/s12874-016-0189-0},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Meta-analytical methods are frequently used to combine dose-response findings expressed in terms of relative risks. However, no methodology has been established when results are summarized in terms of differences in means of quantitative outcomes.
METHODS: We proposed a two-stage approach. A flexible dose-response model is estimated within each study (first stage) taking into account the covariance of the data points (mean differences, standardized mean differences). Parameters describing the study-specific curves are then combined using a multivariate random-effects model (second stage) to address heterogeneity across studies.
RESULTS: The method is fairly general and can accommodate a variety of parametric functions. Compared to traditional non-linear models (e.g. E max, logistic), spline models do not assume any pre-specified dose-response curve. Spline models allow inclusion of studies with a small number of dose levels, and almost any shape, even non monotonic ones, can be estimated using only two parameters. We illustrated the method using dose-response data arising from five clinical trials on an antipsychotic drug, aripiprazole, and improvement in symptoms in shizoaffective patients. Using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), pooled results indicated a non-linear association with the maximum change in mean PANSS score equal to 10.40 (95 \% confidence interval 7.48, 13.30) observed for 19.32 mg/day of aripiprazole. No substantial change in PANSS score was observed above this value. An estimated dose of 10.43 mg/day was found to produce 80 \% of the maximum predicted response.
CONCLUSION: The described approach should be adopted to combine correlated differences in means of quantitative outcomes arising from multiple studies. Sensitivity analysis can be a useful tool to assess the robustness of the overall dose-response curve to different modelling strategies. A user-friendly R package has been developed to facilitate applications by practitioners.},
