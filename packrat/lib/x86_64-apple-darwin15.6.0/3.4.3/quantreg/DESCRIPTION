Title: Quantile Regression
Description: Estimation and inference methods for models of conditional
    quantiles: Linear and nonlinear parametric and non-parametric
    (total variation penalized) models for conditional quantiles of a
    univariate response and several methods for handling censored
    survival data.  Portfolio selection methods based on expected
    shortfall risk are also included.
