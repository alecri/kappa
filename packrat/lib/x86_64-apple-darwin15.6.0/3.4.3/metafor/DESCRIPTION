Description: A comprehensive collection of functions for conducting
    meta-analyses in R. The package includes functions to calculate
    various effect sizes or outcome measures, fit fixed-, random-, and
    mixed-effects models to such data, carry out moderator and
    meta-regression analyses, and create various types of
    meta-analytical plots (e.g., forest, funnel, radial, L'Abbe,
    Baujat, GOSH plots). For meta-analyses of binomial and person-time
    data, the package also provides functions that implement
    specialized methods, including the Mantel-Haenszel method, Peto's
    method, and a variety of suitable generalized linear
    (mixed-effects) models (i.e., mixed-effects logistic and Poisson
    regression models). Finally, the package provides functionality for
    fitting meta-analytic multivariate/multilevel models that account
    for non-independent sampling errors and/or true effects (e.g., due
    to the inclusion of multiple treatment studies, multiple endpoints,
    or other forms of clustering). Network meta-analyses and
    meta-analyses accounting for known correlation structures (e.g.,
    due to phylogenetic relatedness) can also be conducted.
