Title: Accurate Numerical Derivatives
Description: Methods for calculating (usually) accurate numerical first
    and second order derivatives. Accurate calculations are done using
    'Richardson''s' extrapolation or, when applicable, a complex step
    derivative is available. A simple difference method is also
    provided. Simple difference is (usually) less accurate but is much
    quicker than 'Richardson''s' extrapolation and provides a useful
    cross-check. Methods are provided for real scalar and vector valued
    functions.
