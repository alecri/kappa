Description: Regression modeling, testing, estimation, validation,
    graphics, prediction, and typesetting by storing enhanced model
    design attributes in the fit.  'rms' is a collection of functions
    that assist with and streamline modeling.  It also contains
    functions for binary and ordinal logistic regression models,
    ordinal models for continuous Y with a variety of distribution
    families, and the Buckley-James multiple regression model for
    right-censored responses, and implements penalized maximum
    likelihood estimation for logistic and ordinary linear models.
    'rms' works with almost any regression model, but it was especially
    written to work with binary or ordinal regression models, Cox
    regression, accelerated failure time models, ordinary linear
    models, the Buckley-James model, generalized least squares for
    serially or spatially correlated observations, generalized linear
    models, and quantile regression.
