Title: Reimplementations of Functions Introduced Since R-3.0.0
Version: 1.1.1
Author: Michel Lang <michellang@gmail.com>
Maintainer: Michel Lang <michellang@gmail.com>
Description: Implementations of functions which have been introduced in
    R since version 3.0.0. The backports are conditionally exported
    which results in R resolving the function names to the version
    shipped with R (if available) and uses the implemented backports as
    fallback. This way package developers can make use of the new
    functions without worrying about the minimum required R version.
